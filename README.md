# ChE 613A- The Structure and Rheology of Complex fluids (Assignment No.: 5)

**Question:**
Fit a multimode Maxwell model with modulus and relaxation time scales G_i and Tau_i (i = 1 to N) to the given experimental plot of G' and G'' versus Omega. Obtain an expression for relaxation modulus G(t) and plot it with respect to time. Also calculate the shear viscosity (eta). The instructions to obtain the fit is given below. You may just consider this procedure as a starting point.

Procedure for the problem:
1. Extract the data from the image. You can use any software for data extraction. If you do not know any data extraction software, you can use **WebPlotDigitizer**
2. Find the attached file for fitting algorithm and obtain a fit for your data.
3. Obtain an expression for relaxation modulus and shear viscosity in terms of the modulus and relaxation time of multimode Maxwell model obtained from fitting.
